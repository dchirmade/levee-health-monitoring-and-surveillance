# Introduction #

“Levee Health Monitoring and Surveillance (Real-time)” system will help to make sure that the levee’s health is monitored well and alerts will be sent to proper authorities. This should help local authorities and civilian to decide evacuation strategy. This system has following building blocks

  1. Sensor base (IoT : Internet of Things) e.g. Hardware (devices), Software(API) , Simulated (Internet Crawlers)
  1. Real-time Data Acquisition Module (An embedded system)
  1. Event based Real-time Levee health monitoring and surveillance system (standard i386+ system)
  1. Event based rule engine and action to be taken with respective to knowledge base
  1. An emergency alerting system
